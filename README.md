This is a chrome plugin which acts like a utility and makes the time to download images faster.
When you see an image you want to download, just double click on the image and the image will be downloaded in the default download folder.
Some issues are you need the url of the image in the address bar, for eg: .jpg/ .png extensions are downloaded.
